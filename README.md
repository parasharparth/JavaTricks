**In nextline**, code is here to explain that when in a single scanner input, if we have to take the input as integer and strings consecutively, then we have to use sc.nextLine to properly read the string because there are no empty strings after a integer.

**In System.out.printf** System.out.printf("%-15s%03d%n", s1, x); This statement is present to explain how formatting can be done using printf. 
Explanation for %-15s%03d%n is :- ("%-15s%03d%n", s1, x) % : used as a formatter. '-' : minus sign used for left indentation of the string. 15s : here 15 denotes the string's minimum field width 15. '0' : pads the extra 0s in the integer. 3d : here 3 denotes integer's minimum field width 3. %n : prints the new line

**In Table** Printed a table using proper fomatting (println)
